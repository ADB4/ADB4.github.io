#### Hello there!&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you're a friend, stranger, or a web crawler, I'm happy to welcome you to what has been the culmination of a year of experimentation. The content on this site represents everything I've come to learn about these things I consider a part of my craft: programming, visual design, and 3D modeling.&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my intention from the beginning that most everything you see and interact with on this website was implemented by me, with only external dependencies being used for things like Markdown rendering. It would be just me, Google, and *HTML, CSS & JavaScript All-in-One For Dummies* by Paul McFredries, the latter having proved to be monumental.&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So have a look, mess around, and do feel free to get in touch if needed.&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
## Andy
