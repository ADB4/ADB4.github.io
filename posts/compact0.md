#### Hello there!&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortune, good night: smile once more; turn thy wheel.

I moved to Austin, Texas in August for a new job. The nineteen-hour drive from Michigan in which I packed my 2009 Nissan Murano to the brim was nothing short of deiform. U.S. Route 69 through Oklahoma

I had come straight from work in downtown Austin to test drive the F-TYPE at CarMax in South Austin. What was, on a late Monday morning a 15 minute drive with sparse traffic (Many office workers in Austin work from home on Monday and Friday), turned into an hour-long drive one-way at 5PM.

My first drive in the F-TYPE was, for many reasons, tepid. By 6PM the traffic was coming down from its peak, but still the roads weren't nearly vacant enough to be able to wring out all five-hundred and fifty horses. For me, however, this came secondary to the fact that up until then the fastest car I had ever driven was, as of a month before at the same CarMax, a BMW M440i Gran Coupe. Prior to that, it was an E90 BMW 328i in 2013.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So have a look, mess around, and do feel free to get in touch if needed.&nbsp;
